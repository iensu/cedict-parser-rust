* Cedict parser

A simple tool to parse a [[https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict][Cedict Chinese - English dictionary file]].

I mainly built this to experiment with file parsing and containerization of rust projects.

** How to run

The executable doesn't really do much, but anyway:

#+begin_src shell
  cargo build --release
  ./target/release/cedict-parser ./cedict_ts_sample.u8
#+end_src
